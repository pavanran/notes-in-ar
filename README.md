# notes-in-ar
A lightweight AR productivity app for smart glasses. Capture quick notes and reminders hands-free using your voice. Tag them, search them, set time-based reminders, and pin them into your AR dashboard so they’re always visible in your field of view.


Notes and reminders appear overlaid.

Voice commands:

“note buy milk” → capture a note

“show notes work” → filter by tag

“remind me in 10 minutes” → AR popup reminder

“pin note 1” → keep a note always on your dashboard
